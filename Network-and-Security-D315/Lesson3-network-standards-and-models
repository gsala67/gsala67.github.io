# Lesson 3: Networking Standards and Models

Learning different standards

802.11 (commonly known as Wi-Fi) are a set of protocols developed by the IEEE to govern wireless LAN communications and include popular versions, like 802.11a, b, g, n, and ac, each offering varying bandwidth and frequency capabilities.

Ethernet standards, on the other hand, dictate wired network comms and have varieties, such as 10BASE-T (10 Mbps), 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet at 100 Mbps),
and 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet at 1 Gbps).

Comparatively, the OSI model and the TCP/IP stack serve as conceptual freamworks for understanding network interactions. The OSI model breaking into seven layers, and TCP/IP stack simplifies this into four layers;

* link
* internet
* transport
* application


## 3.1 Standards


### 802.11 Wireless

* speed
* transmission range
* frequency

802.11

Came out in 1980 in February, hence the '80' and the '2' for Feb.

### IEE 802.11

* 1-2Mbps over 2.4 GHz frequency
    + we'll only be dealing with 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz

This is where the two biggest incompability comes into play, both these frequencies are incompatible with each other. Today's standards are 1-2Mbps are slow.

### IEEE 802.11a

Speed of up to 54 Mbps over 5GHz frequency. 'a' is much faster the its predecessor.

### IEEE 802.11b

Because of the incompability, they came out with 'b'. But 'b' is compatible with the original RFC. Which made it much more convenient at a slower speed (11Mbps)

### IEEE 802.11g

* 54Mbps
* 2.4Ghz compatible with B and the original

### IEEE 802.11ac

* 433 Mbps to 1.3Gbps
* way faster, only achievable over the 5Ghz, which discards compatibility

### IEEE 802.11ax

* Wi-Fi6
* Next generation standard in WiFi technology.
* Greater speeds and stability
* Up to 14Gbps
