## Network Commands for Windows



## Network Commands for Linux

## Summary

Both Linux and Windows operating systems offer a diverse set of networking commands essential for troubleshooting and configuration. 

* The ipconfig command in Windows provides details about network adapters and their configurations—similar to the ifconfig command in Linux. 
* IPv6 addresses—which are 128 bits long—use hexadecimal notation separated by colons, while IPv4 addresses are dotted decimals. 
* The nslookup command allows users to query DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses; this functionality is present in both operating systems. 
* In Windows, the arp -a command reveals the mapping of IP addresses to physical MAC addresses, which is crucial for local network communication. 
* The netstat command provides network statistics and can display active connections, listening ports, and associated addresses; this tool is available in both Linux and Windows. 
* Both systems utilize ICMP for tools like ping and traceroute (or tracert in Windows) to test network connectivity and trace network paths. 

Understanding and effectively using these commands is critical for IT professionals to diagnose, configure, and manage network interfaces and connections in both Linux and Windows environments.
